This is using tailwind v4, always use shadcn when it makes sense. this is next js 15 app router. 
I want to use drizzle kit, neon, and netlify. I have the netlify cli installed
all tables for this project will start with "tada_"
Use css variables for font, colors, and spacing with tailwind
use server actions instead of api routes whenever possible
routes should be modular with their own folder for components and serveractions. components that will be reused by the whole site should be stored in a main components folder.

shadcn is now shadcn not shadcn-ui

beware -  `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.  react/no-unescaped-entities

## CSS Variables System
- Database-driven CSS variables stored in `tada_css_variables` table (Drizzle + Neon)
- Variables loaded in layout.tsx before page render and injected into :root
- Fallback system: database values override defaults in `lib/css-variables.ts`
- Default primary font: Quicksand (with fallbacks if DB unavailable)
- Categories: typography, colors, spacing
- Use `var(--variable-name)` in styles, always with fallbacks
- Seeding script available: `npm run db:seed`

- CSS variables should be used in inline styles or style props, not just classes
