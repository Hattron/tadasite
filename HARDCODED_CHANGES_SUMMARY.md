# Hardcoded Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove copy and style settings from the admin panel and hardcode them instead, while continuing to use CSS variables.

## Overview

The TaDa! Interiors website has been updated to use hardcoded CSS variables and copy content instead of dynamic database-driven content. This simplifies the admin panel and improves performance by removing database queries for styling and copy content.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Variables Hardcoded

**File: `app/globals.css`** (MODIFIED)
- Added Google Fonts import at the top: `@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap");`
- Added hardcoded CSS variables directly in the file, including all variables that were previously stored in the database
- Includes typography, colors, spacing, and component sizing variables
- Values extracted from the database at the time of migration:
  - Primary font: Inter
  - Secondary font: Inter  
  - Primary color: #485775
  - Secondary color: #e3c863
  - Accent color: #cacac9
  - Background: #fafafa
  - Text color: #0d0d0d
  - Text muted: #dcdfe5
- Added font-family application to body and heading elements

### 2. Copy Content Hardcoded

**File: `lib/hardcoded-copy.ts`** (NEW)
- Created a comprehensive file containing all copy content that was previously stored in the database
- Includes content for:
  - Home page about us section (3 paragraphs)
  - About page team section
  - About page approach section (philosophy, unique approach, why choose us)
  - Maureen bio (5 paragraphs)
  - Joanna bio (8 paragraphs)
  - Contact page business hours and services
- Provides helper functions that match the original API:
  - `getCopyContent(key: string)`
  - `getCopyContents(keys: string[])`
  - `getCopyContentByPage(page: string)`
  - `getCopyContentBySection(page: string, section: string)`

### 3. Component Updates

All components that previously used dynamic copy content have been updated:

**Updated Components:**
- `app/contact/page.tsx` - Now uses `getCopyContents()` from hardcoded copy
- `components/AboutUsAnimated.tsx` - Converted from async to sync, uses hardcoded copy
- `components/Team.tsx` - Converted from async to sync, uses hardcoded copy
- `components/MaureenBio.tsx` - Individual paragraphs now use `getCopyContent()`
- `components/JoannaBio.tsx` - Individual paragraphs now use `getCopyContent()`
- `components/OurApproach.tsx` - Converted from async to sync, uses hardcoded copy

### 4. Admin Panel Simplified

**File: `app/admin/page.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
- Removed tabs interface
- Removed Copy Settings and Style Settings tabs
- Now only shows Gallery Management
- Simplified layout with single-purpose interface

**Deleted Files:**
- `components/admin/copy/` (entire directory)
- `components/admin/styles/` (entire directory)
- `components/admin/index.ts` updated to only export gallery components

### 5. Layout Optimization

**File: `app/layout.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
- Removed dynamic CSS variable loading
- Removed async function declaration
- Removed database queries for CSS variables
- Now relies on hardcoded CSS imports
- Simplified and improved performance

### 6. Database Values Extracted

The following values were extracted from the database before hardcoding:

**CSS Variables:**
```
--font-primary: Inter, sans-serif
--font-secondary: Inter, sans-serif
--color-primary: #485775
--color-secondary: #e3c863
--color-accent: #cacac9
--color-background: #fafafa
--color-text: #0d0d0d
--color-text-muted: #dcdfe5
--spacing-xs: 0.25rem
--spacing-sm: 0.5rem
--spacing-md: 1rem
--spacing-lg: 1.5rem
--spacing-xl: 2rem
```

**Copy Content:** 34 pieces of content across home, about, and contact pages

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Eliminated database queries for CSS and copy content
2. **Simplicity**: Removed complex admin interfaces for content management
3. **Reliability**: No dependency on database availability for styling and copy
4. **Maintainability**: Content is now version-controlled and easily auditable
5. **Build Optimization**: Faster builds and static generation

## CSS Variables Still Used

The site continues to use CSS variables throughout all components, but now they are:
- Defined in hardcoded CSS files instead of database
- Loaded at build time instead of runtime
- Consistent across all pages without database dependency

## Admin Panel Functionality

The admin panel now focuses solely on:
- Gallery management
- Image uploads and organization
- Image metadata editing

All copy and styling functionality has been removed from the admin interface.

## Migration Notes

- All existing CSS variable names and values have been preserved
- All existing copy content has been preserved exactly as it was in the database
- Component APIs remain the same for easy maintenance
- Fallback values are provided for all content

This migration maintains the flexible CSS variable system while improving performance and simplifying the codebase. All CSS variables are now consolidated in the main `globals.css` file for easier maintenance and proper import order.
